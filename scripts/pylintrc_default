[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
# DEFAULT:  disable=
# RATIONALE:
# - maybe-no-member:  bi-modal functions confuse pylint type inference.
# - no-member:  indirections in protobuf-generated code
# - protected-access: helpers use '_foo' of classes from generated code.
# - similarities:  'Bucket' and 'Blob' define 'metageneration' and 'owner' with
#                  identical implementation but different docstrings.
# - star-args:  standard Python idioms for varargs:
#                  ancestor = Query().filter(*order_props)
# - redefined-variable-type: This error is overzealous and complains at e.g.
#                      if some_prop:
#                          return int(value)
#                      else:
#                          return float(value)
# - import-error: imports are checked via tests.
# - wrong-import-position: This error is overzealous. It assumes imports are
#                          completed whenever something non-trivial is
#                          defined, e.g.
#                              try:
#                                  from foo import Bar
#                              except ImportError:
#                                  class Bar(object):
#                                      """Hi everyone"""
#                          and thus causes subsequent imports to be
#                          diagnosed as out-of-order.
# - no-name-in-module: Error gives a lot of false positives for names which
#                      are defined dynamically. Also, any truly missing names
#                      will be detected by our 100% code coverage.
#
# New opinions in pylint 1.6, enforcing PEP 257.  #1968 for eventual fixes
